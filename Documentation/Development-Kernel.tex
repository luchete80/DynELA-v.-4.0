\chapter{DynELA Kernel library}

\startcontents[chapters]
\printmyminitoc[2]\LETTRINE{T}he \DynELA~Kernel library is the lowest library of all the \DynELA~libraries. It contains basic classes that allow the definition of the non-mathematical functions of the \DynELA. We find in this library the List class allowing to manage the objects of the \DynELA, the String classes, the basic options, the management of the log files,...

\begin{tcolorbox}[width=\textwidth,myArgs,tabularx={ll|R}]
String & s & System command to launch.
\end{tcolorbox}

This method executes an external command. Launching a new process through the system() command.
The new program is a new process totally independent from the current application.
The only link is that the calling program waits for the end of the execution of the new process to continue the operations (except if we use the magic parameter \& in the command line...).
Do you know System?). As this command is simple, the working environment for the execution of the new process is /bin/sh. An error message is generated if a problem is encountered during execution.
For more complex situations, it will be necessary to use the "classic" fork() and exec() program launch methods. But this inevitably leads to threads problems and that's another story actually ;-0

\section{The List class}

The List class is a basic class in the \DynELA. It is even at the origin of all the developments made in finite element and numerical computation since 1992. Its development is at the heart of the PostCopo and F3R applications which were realized during my thesis work between 1992 and 1996. Originally, it was written in C language and was thus a dynamic list of pointers on \textbf{void$\star$} which was violently (and yes I assume this) casted, during the definition of the list, into pointers on the real elements of the list. The automatic dynamic memory allocation mechanism for the list in increments of $10$, in general, was already present in the first version of this list in C. Later, with the advent of \Cpp~, this list was switched to its current form with the template mechanism provided by the \Cpp~language.

% Automatic documentation generated from the DynELA source code
% Do not change anything in this LaTeX file between the @DOC and the @END keywords.
\textcolor{purple}{\textbf{List::List}}\label{List::List}\index[DL]{List!List}\\
Management of objects as List.

This class is used to store all type of object and manipulate them as a list (for example: list of Nodes, Elements, Boundary conditions,...).
This List is a dynamic one, the initialization is performed with a default stack size defined by DEFAULT\_stack\_size, as soon as there is no more space left to store a new object,
the List size is increased with respect to the DEFAULT\_stack\_inc value.

% Do not change anything in this LaTeX file between the @DOC and the @END keywords.
\textcolor{purple}{\textbf{List::List(long size)}}\label{List::List(long size)}\index[DL]{List!List(long size)}\\
Constructor of the List class.

\begin{tcolorbox}[width=\textwidth,myArgs,tabularx={ll|R}]
long & size & Initial size of the list (default value DEFAULT\_stack\_inc).
\end{tcolorbox}

This constructor allocates the default memory for an instance of the List class.
If the size of the list is not specified, the default size is taken into account, which is defined by the value of DEFAULT\_stack\_size.
%@END

\subsection{Basic methods}

%@DOC:List::redim(long size)
% Automatic documentation generated from the DynELA source code
% Do not change anything in this LaTeX file between the @DOC and the @END keywords.
\textcolor{purple}{\textbf{List::redim(long size)}}\label{List::redim(long size)}\index[DL]{List!redim(long size)}\\
Resize the storage space of a List.

\begin{tcolorbox}[width=\textwidth,myArgs,tabularx={ll|R}]
long & size & New size of the list.
\end{tcolorbox}

This method is used to increase or decrease the size of a list.
If the proposed new size is smaller than the minimum size needed to store the current elements of the list, an error is generated.\\
This method should generally not be called by the user (unless the user has mastered the trick).
This method is heavily used internally by the other methods of the class.
In case the user does not master this kind of operation sufficiently, it is better to let the class manage its own memory allocations.\\
A possible use of this method is memory pre-allocation, when the number of objects that will be stored in the list is known in advance.
The size of the list is then adjusted to this value, which avoids dynamic size adjustment operations that take CPU time.
Of course, dynamic allocation mechanisms exist and you can exceed this value.

% Automatic documentation generated from the DynELA source code
% Do not change anything in this LaTeX file between the @DOC and the @END keywords.
\textcolor{purple}{\textbf{List::close(~)}}\label{List::close()}\index[DL]{List!close(~)}\\
This method closes the List, i.e. resize the stack size to the number of elements to save memory.

This method is used to adjust the size of the list according to the number of real objects in the list.
This method allows to recover memory space, mainly for small lists.

\begin{tcolorbox}[width=\textwidth,myArgs,tabularx={ll|R}]
long & index & Index of the element to get in the list.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{The ListIndex class}

The ListIndex class is an extension of the List class, where objects contain an internal number used to manage the objects inside the list.

% Do not change anything in this LaTeX file between the @DOC and the @END keywords.
\textcolor{purple}{\textbf{ListIndex::ListIndex}}\label{ListIndex::ListIndex}\index[DL]{ListIndex!ListIndex}\\
Management of objects as ListIndex.

This class is used to store all type of object and manipulate them as a listIndex (for example: listIndex of Nodes, Elements, Boundary conditions,...).
This ListIndex is a dynamic one, the initialization is performed with a default stack size defined by DEFAULT\_stack\_size, as soon as there is no more space left to store a new object,
the ListIndex size is increased with respect to the DEFAULT\_stack\_inc value.

\begin{tcolorbox}[width=\textwidth,myArgs,tabularx={ll|R}]

\end{tcolorbox}

This constructor allocates the default memory for an instance of the List class.
If the size of the list is not specified, the default size is taken into account, which is defined by the value of DEFAULT\_stack\_size.
